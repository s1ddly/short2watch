# short2watch
This bookmarklet is used to quickly convert youtube short URL's to watch URL's.  
This can be useful as youtube watch URL's have a better interface, and more features(rewind, fast foward, skip to section, playback speed)  

## Usage
Click on the bookmarklet.  
If you are already on the page of the short, you will automatically be redirected.  
Otherwise, you will be greeted with a prompt to enter the URL of the short you would like to convert.
